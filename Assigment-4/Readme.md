## Overview

This python script generates a sampler for _Gaussian distribution_ using inverse CDF method. It also plots a histogram using random numbers from a uniform distribution.

## Execution

To run the progrm use the following command

```python
python3 gaussian.py
```

1. Afer executing the command the the program asks for the inputs $a$ and $b$.
2. Inputs shouls be a valid range i.e. $a<b$.
3. After taking the inputs it generates a histogram of normalised area $1$ along with the theortical gaussian distribution.

**Note:** This is a dynamic simulation outputs may vary for every run of the program.
