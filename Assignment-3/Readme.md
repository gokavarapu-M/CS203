## Overview

This Python script simulates an extended version of the Monty Hall problem and generates 3D surface plots to visualize the probabilities involved.
<br>
<br>
This script extends the problem by allowing for varying numbers of doors ($n$) and a variable number of cars behind the doors ($k$). It is a simulation to assess the probability of winning for switching ($W$) versus sticking ($T$) to the original decision. Plot a surface plot of $n$, $k$ versus $(P(win|W)/P(win|T))$.
<br>
<br>
From this plot we can infer that $(P(win|W)/P(win|T))$ doesn't depend on value of $k$.

## Exceution:

To run the progrm use the following command

```python
python monty.py
```

## Output:

The outputs images of the plot generated by the program for a run are attached in this folder [3D-View](Monty.png) and [Side-View](sideview.png). From the images we can infer that the ratio is independent of value of $k$.

**Note:** This is a dynamic simulation outputs may vary for every run of the program.
