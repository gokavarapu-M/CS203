## Overview

This Python script performs _Bayesian analysis_ on a set of coin flip data. It uses the Beta distribution to model the prior and posterior distributions of the coin's bias (probability of landing heads).

The script visualizes the prior and posterior distributions for different sets of prior hyperparameters, calculates Maximum Likelihood Estimates (MLE), and Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) estimates.

## Execution

To run the progrm use the following command

```python
python3 beta.py
```

The script will generate plots showing priro and posterior distributions for different cases. [(**Output**)](./image.png)
